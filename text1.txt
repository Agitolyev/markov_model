Hello, darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a streetlamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
No one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

"Fools," said I, "You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you."
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, "The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whispered in the sounds of silence."

I know you wanted me to keep my mouth shut
Because you hate it when I speak my mind
I suffer through but it feels so messed up
Like my opinion is a waste of time
We never wanted it to be this way
They never listen to a word we say
So scream your heart out
You are the chosen
You got to show them
Silence is the enemy
Scream it out loud
We are the broken
We got to show them
Silence is the enemy
You take your needles and sow my mouth shut
But you will never hear the last of me
This is the reason why we're all so fucked up
You are the reason why we don't believe
We never wanted it to be this way
They never listen to a word we say
So scream your heart out
You are the chosen
You got to show them
Silence is the enemy
Scream it out loud
We are the broken
We got to show them
Silence is the enemy
Scream it out loud
Silence is the enemy
Scream it out loud
Silence is the enemy
You got to show them
Silence is the enemy
Scream your heart out
You are the chosen
You got to show them
Silence is the enemy
Scream it out loud
We are the broken
We got to show them
Silence is the enemy
Scream it out loud
Silence is the enemy
Scream it out loud
Silence is the enemy
Scream it out loud
Silence is the enemy
